**About me**
- 👋 Hi, I’m Brad. I moved to Switzerland 5 years ago to work in academic research. After a fulfilling journey, I'm ready to leave and pursue new opportunities that utilize my data analysis experience.
- 👨‍🔬 My scientific background is mainly in geology, but I have also done work in environmental science, spatial analysis (e.g., GIS), and youth education.  
- 🌱 I’m currently adapting my analysis skills for business insight applications by learning more about machine learning techniques and how to select the right models for my analysis questions.
- 📫 Send me an email at bjpeters2@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- 🗨️ English is my native language. Ich spreche auch Deutsch und verfüge über gute Kentnisse vom Schweizerdeutschen. He estudiado español en el colegio y entonces hablaba mucho, pero me siento que perdí mucho cuando aprendí alemán - solo necesito encontrarlo de nuevo!
  
**My analytics experience**
- I'm trained as an analytical chemist, which means I place particular emphasis on assuring data quality (crap in/crap out).
- It also means I am fine-tuned to understand whether data are actually answering the question I'm asking, or whether there is internal linearity that produces misleading or erroneous results.
- What I can do:
-   Data statistics: descriptive statistics, similarity analysis (e.g. t-test, ANOVA), correlation analysis, bootstrapping, dimension reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
-   Numerical simulation: outcome prediction, Monte Carlo simulation, Bayesian probability models
-   Machine learning: classification, supervised and unsupervised clustering, natural language processing
-   Large datasets: identify compatible data, clean, and merge it appropriately into actionable corpora

**Who I want to be in my next job**
- I know I'm not your typical candidate: I don't have a computer science degree, I don't do web development (yet), and I don't even come from a 'heavily quantitative' natural science like physics.
- I want to be the other perspective in the room. I want to apply my years of critical thinking experience to new problems and design solutions that go beyond the pedagogical norm for data science.
- Clearly there will be some domain knowledge to acquire along the way. But I can't tell you how many new tools or software I've learned to use over the year, when the application need was right. So, I'm up for the challenge.

**Fun fact**
- ⚡ Some langugages, most of them threatened or extinct, use an living/non-living (e.g. Kurdish and Algonquin languages) rather than a masculine/feminine (e.g., germanic and romance languages) grammatical duality. Speakers of these langugaes report this has a commanding influence on how they perceive environmental issues and sustainability.

Please have a look at my repository to see some examples of my analytical capabilities!
